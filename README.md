# StockML
Basic Template for Stock Market _using Machine Learning integration

Summary - StockML was designed as an intuitive and extensible template for applying machine learning to stock predictions. As of May 2024, the project is being actively maintained by me and my friend. I am currently a freshman college student (about to be sophomore) studying economics, comp sci, and finance. 

Key Components - Data prep is using the python extension called pandas. Primarily focused on preparing historical stock prices and other fundamentals.

The Model -  Using an analyzer to form the relationship between stock fundamentals and annual price changes relative to an index.

Backend Testing - To conduct a basic backend test before generating predictions on current data already accessed on the current data spread. 

Outcomes - The project serves as a foundation for creating a (somewhat) profitable trading system though live trading based solely on this code is not recommended. 

The author has reported around 20% returns on the backend testing and approximentaly 10-15% on live trading with a modifed version fo this code not freely shown on git.\

Personal Significance:
first major python machine learning project.
