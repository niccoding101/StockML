# StockML
Machine Learning of Stock Market


Summary:
StockML was designed as an intuitive and extensible template for applying machine learning to stock predictions. As of May 2024, the project is no longer actively maintained. Its goal is to help users understand the workflow of using machine learning for stock predictions, highlighting the subtleties involved. Users are encouraged to make their own improvements, with suggestions provided in the readme.

Key Components:
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preparing historical stock prices and fundamentals using pandas.
Model Training: Employing a scikit-learn classifier to identify relationships between stock fundamentals and annual price changes compared to an index.
Backtesting: Conducting a basic backtest before generating predictions on current data.
Outcomes:
The project serves as a foundation for creating a profitable trading system, though live trading based solely on this code is not recommended. The author has reported around 20% returns on backtests and 10-15% on live trading with a modified version of this code.
Personal Significance:
This project marks the authorâ€™s first major Python project, encounter with machine learning, and use of Git. Although many improvements have been made, some minor issues may still exist.
Disclaimer:
This is an educational project, and backtested performance may not accurately predict future results. Trade at your own risk.
